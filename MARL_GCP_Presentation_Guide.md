# MARL for Google Cloud Provisioning: Presentation Guide

## Project Overview

This project implements a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system for automating cloud resource provisioning on Google Cloud Platform. The system uses specialized agents to manage different resource types (compute, storage, network, database) and optimize resource allocation based on workload patterns derived from Google Cluster Data.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. System Architecture

- **Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution**: Agents are trained using shared information but execute decisions independently
- **Specialized Agents**: Separate agents for compute, storage, network, and database resources
- **OpenAI Gym Interface**: Standard RL interface for environment interaction
- **Experience Sharing**: Agents learn from each other's experiences through a shared buffer

### 2. GCP Environment Simulation

- **Resource Constraints**: Models maximum limits for instances, CPUs, memory, storage, and budget
- **Pricing Dynamics**: Simulates GCP pricing models for different resource types and regions
- **Provisioning Delays**: Realistically models the time lag between requesting resources and their availability
- **Service Interdependencies**: Captures relationships between compute, storage, network, and database services

### 3. Google Cluster Data Processing

- **Data Pipeline**: Processes Google Cluster Data to extract realistic workload patterns
- **Workload Patterns**: 
  - **Steady-state**: Consistent resource demands with minor variations
  - **Burst**: Sudden spikes in resource demands followed by returns to baseline
  - **Cyclical**: Time-based patterns (e.g., day/night cycles, weekday/weekend)
- **Feature Extraction**: Derives CPU, memory, storage, and network usage patterns from raw data

### 4. Agent Implementation

- **TD3 Algorithm**: Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient implementation for continuous action spaces
- **Actor-Critic Architecture**: Policy networks (actors) to select actions and value networks (critics) to evaluate them
- **Exploration Strategy**: Noise-based exploration with parameter tuning
- **State Preprocessing**: Custom observation processing for each agent type

## Code Execution Results

The code runs successfully and demonstrates:

1. **Environment Initialization**: Proper setup of observation and action spaces for each agent
2. **Workload Generation**: Successfully creates different workload patterns based on processed data
3. **Resource Provisioning**: Simulates resource allocation with appropriate delays
4. **Reward Calculation**: Provides feedback based on resource utilization and cost efficiency
5. **Visualization**: Generates meaningful plots of resource usage, costs, and rewards

## Demonstration Highlights

### Workload Patterns

The system successfully visualizes three distinct workload patterns:
- **Steady**: Shows consistent resource demands with minor variations
- **Burst**: Demonstrates sudden spikes in demand that test the system's adaptability
- **Cyclical**: Illustrates time-based patterns that reflect real-world usage cycles

### Resource Provisioning

The logs show the environment:
1. Scheduling resource changes with realistic delays
2. Applying changes when delays expire
3. Calculating appropriate rewards based on how well resources match demands

### Performance Metrics

The visualizations show:
1. **Resource Usage**: How instances, CPUs, memory, and storage change over time
2. **Costs**: Breakdown of expenses by service type
3. **Rewards**: How well the system performs at each step

## Technical Achievements
