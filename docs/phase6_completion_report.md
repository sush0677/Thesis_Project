# Phase 6 Completion Report: Agent Coordination Mechanism

## Overview

Phase 6 focused on the coordination of multiple MARL agents within the system architecture, enabling effective resource allocation in the cloud provisioning environment.

## âœ… COMPLETED COMPONENTS

### 1. Implicit Coordination
- **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution**: Agents are trained with access to global state information (via critics) but act independently during execution.
- **Shared Experience Buffer**: All agents share experiences, which helps align their learning and promotes cooperative behavior.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Agents demonstrate cooperative behavior and improved resource allocation through shared learning.

## Next Steps
- Integrate with GCP deployment layer (see Phase 7).
- Explore advanced coordination mechanisms in future work if needed.

This document summarizes the coordination mechanisms implemented in Phase 6. For code details, see the relevant agent and system architecture modules in `src/marl_gcp/`.
