# Phase 5 Completion Report: Training Infrastructure Setup

## Overview

Phase 5 established the training infrastructure for MARL agents, enabling efficient learning and experimentation.

## âœ… COMPLETED COMPONENTS

### 1. Training Pipeline
- **Single-Process Training**: Training is managed through the main script and system architecture, supporting sequential experience collection and agent updates.
- **Experience Replay**: Utilizes a shared experience buffer for sampling and updating agent policies.
- **Model Saving/Loading**: Agents can save and load their models for reproducibility and evaluation.

### 2. Configuration & Logging
- **Configurable Parameters**: Training parameters (episodes, batch size, learning rate, etc.) are managed via configuration files and command-line arguments.
- **Logging**: Training progress and results are logged to both console and file for analysis.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Agents can be trained and evaluated in a reproducible manner.
- Training runs and results are well-logged for future reference.

## Next Steps
- Integrate with GCP for real-world deployment (see Phase 7).
- Explore distributed or parallel training in future work if needed.
