# Introduction

## 3.1 Project Background

Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations deploy and manage their IT infrastructure, offering unprecedented scalability and flexibility. However, the dynamic nature of cloud workloads presents significant challenges in resource provisioning and management. Traditional approaches rely on static policies and manual intervention, often leading to either over-provisioning (wasting resources and increasing costs) or under-provisioning (degrading performance and user experience).

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) represents one of the most sophisticated cloud infrastructures globally, handling diverse workloads from small applications to enterprise-scale systems. The complexity of GCP's resource management stems from its heterogeneous nature, including compute instances, storage systems, networking components, and database services, each with different performance characteristics and cost structures.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges. By deploying specialized agents for different resource types, MARL systems can learn optimal resource allocation strategies through continuous interaction with the environment. This approach offers several advantages over traditional methods:

- **Adaptive Learning**: Agents continuously learn from experience, improving their decision-making over time
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Can balance competing objectives like cost, performance, and reliability
- **Scalability**: Distributed decision-making allows for handling complex, large-scale systems
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Rapid response to changing workload patterns and resource availability

This project implements a comprehensive MARL system specifically designed for GCP resource provisioning, leveraging real Google Cluster data to ensure practical relevance and realistic performance evaluation.
