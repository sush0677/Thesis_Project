# Abstract

This final report presents a comprehensive analysis of a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system designed for dynamic cloud resource provisioning. The project explores innovative approaches to optimize resource allocation in cloud environments, emphasizing both efficiency and scalability. The system leverages state-of-the-art techniques in reinforcement learning to address challenges in heterogeneous and evolving cloud infrastructures. Key accomplishments include improved task scheduling, reduced operational costs, and enhanced overall system performance.

The report details the system architecture, experimental setup, evaluation metrics, and comparative analysis with traditional resource management methodologies. It also discusses the integration of AI-powered tools for coding and report generation, underscoring the practical impact of generative AI in accelerating research and development processes.

This abstract serves as a concise overview of the project, outlining the objectives, methodologies, and significant outcomes achieved. It lays the foundation for a deeper discussion in the subsequent sections of the final report.
