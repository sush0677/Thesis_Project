# Abstract

This research presents a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system for intelligent cloud resource management on Google Cloud Platform. The work addresses the fundamental challenge of optimizing resource allocation across compute, storage, network, and database services in dynamic cloud environments where traditional rule-based approaches fail to handle complex interdependencies and evolving workload patterns.

The system employs four specialized agents using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, each responsible for a specific resource type while coordinating through shared experience learning. The approach reflects real-world cloud operations practices where specialized teams manage different infrastructure components. The architecture enables continuous adaptation to changing workloads while balancing multiple competing objectives including cost efficiency, performance, reliability, and environmental sustainability.

Key technical contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture that mirrors operational team structures, (2) integration of authentic Google Cluster trace data comprising 576 production workload records for realistic evaluation, (3) algorithm selection specifically tailored to cloud management constraints, and (4) multi-objective optimization framework that balances competing business priorities.

Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional approaches: 78.5% CPU utilization efficiency (vs. 63.2% baseline), 36.9% cost reduction ($687.50 vs. $1,089.20 monthly), 33.4% response time improvement (89.7ms vs. 134.7ms), and 27.6% carbon footprint reduction.

The research demonstrates that reinforcement learning principles naturally align with cloud resource management characteristics - sequential decision-making requirements, temporal dependencies, and multi-objective optimization needs. The system's ability to handle real workload variability using production data indicates strong practical applicability for enterprise cloud deployments, with potential for significant cost savings and performance improvements that justify implementation complexity.

This work establishes a foundation for several promising research directions: federated learning approaches for multi-cloud resource management, integration with edge computing environments for latency-sensitive applications, and exploration of quantum-inspired optimization algorithms for resource allocation problems with exponential state spaces.

The comprehensive evaluation methodology and open-source implementation provide a benchmarking framework for future research in AI-driven cloud resource management, potentially accelerating development in this critical field.
