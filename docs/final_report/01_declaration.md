# Final Report Declaration and GenAI Usage

## Honour Code Declaration

I hereby declare that this final report is my own work and that I have not engaged in any form of academic dishonesty. All sources, references, and inspirations have been properly acknowledged. I affirm that this report complies with all the ethical standards and guidelines set forth by my institution.

## GenAI Usage Declaration

I declare that I have utilized generative AI tools in the preparation of this final report for tasks such as drafting initial content, editing, and formatting assistance. Specifically:

- For coding tasks, I used the Claude Sonnet models to assist in generating and refining code snippets, debugging, and optimizing algorithms, which streamlined my development process.

- For report creation and language refinement, I leveraged GPT models to generate initial drafts, enhance clarity, and improve the overall coherence of the textual content, thereby significantly reducing manual editing time.

All AI contributions have been critically reviewed and incorporated into the final work with careful oversight to maintain accuracy and integrity.
