# Phase 8 Completion Report: Evaluation Framework

## Overview

Phase 8 focused on evaluating the MARL system's performance using simulation results and visualizations.

## âœ… COMPLETED COMPONENTS

- **Performance Analysis**: Training and evaluation metrics are logged and visualized using plots (see `visualizations/` directory).
- **Result Reporting**: Results are summarized in markdown reports and figures.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- The MARL system demonstrates effective learning and resource allocation in simulation.
- Visualizations provide insight into agent performance and system behavior.

## Next Steps
- Expand evaluation to additional real-world workloads and baseline comparisons in future work.
