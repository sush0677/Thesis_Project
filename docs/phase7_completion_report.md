# Phase 7 Completion Report: GCP Integration Layer

## Overview

Phase 7 is reserved for future work on integrating the MARL system with real Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure. As of now, the system operates in simulation mode only.

## âœ… CURRENT STATUS

- The environment and agents are designed to support future integration with GCP APIs and real resource provisioning.
- Configuration files include placeholders for GCP project IDs and related parameters.

## Next Steps
- Implement GCP API calls and infrastructure-as-code translation for real-world deployment.
- Add monitoring, validation, and security features as integration progresses.
