This document outlines the thesis project proposal on Multi-Agent Reinforce-
ment Learning (MARL) for Cloud Resource Allocation, detailing its alignment
with the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, scope, dataset, out-
comes, activities, beneficiaries, novelty, and timeline targeting completion by
mid-August 2025.
Alignment with MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Ma-
chine Learning
This project aligns with the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learn-
ing by applying advanced MARL techniques, such as Q-learning and Multi-Agent
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), to optimize cloud resource al-
location. It leverages core curriculum topics like reinforcement learning and
multi-agent systems to address a real-world challenge, showcasing technical pro-
ficiency and research innovation suitable for a master’s thesis.
Project Overview
The project develops AI agents to manage cloud computing resources efficiently,
akin to smart traffic lights optimizing city traffic. Each agent, trained using algo-
rithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and MADDPG, allocates server
resources, learns from dynamic workloads, and balances cooperation (system-
wide efficiency) with competition (individual performance), outperforming static
industry methods.
Dataset Requirements
The project uses a simulated cloud environment generating:
•Workload traces mimicking real-world cloud usage (e.g., Google Cluster Data).
•System metrics like server utilization and latency.

•Agent decision logs for training and evaluation.
Built with Python (Gym, Stable-Baselines3), the simulation ensures realistic, scal-
able testing.
Expected Outcomes
The project will deliver:
•Novel MARL algorithms, extending Q-learning and MADDPG for cooperative-
competitive resource allocation.
•Improved efficiency (reduced energy waste, enhanced throughput) com-
pared to industry baselines.
•Scalable framework for large-scale cloud systems.
•Publishable results for AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS).
•Practical solutions for cloud providers.
Project Activities
The project involves:
•Building a cloud simulation environment.
•Developing MARL agents using PyTorch/TensorFlow with PPO and MAD-
DPG.
•Integrating cooperative-competitive algorithms.
•Evaluating performance against baselines.
•Documenting findings for thesis and publication.
Beneficiaries
The project benefits:
•Cloud Providers : Reduced costs and improved service quality.
•Researchers : New MARL insights from hybrid algorithms.
•Users : Faster , reliable cloud services.
•Society : Energy-efficient computing for sustainability.
Novelty and Innovation
The project introduces a novel hybrid MARL framework combining coopera-
tion and competition, extending algorithms like Q-learning and MADDPG. Unlike
single-focus approaches, it offers real-time adaptability and scalability to large
systems, addressing research gaps and providing innovative, industry-relevant
solutions for resource efficiency.

Timeline
The project is structured over 7 weeks to meet the mid-August 2025 deadline
(July 1 to August 15, 2025):
•Week 1 (Jul 1-7) : Set up simulation environment and implement baseline
methods.
•Week 2 (Jul 8-14) : Develop single-agent MARL models using PPO.
•Week 3 (Jul 15-21) : Benchmark single-agent models and refine algorithms.
•Week 4 (Jul 22-28) : Implement multi-agent framework with MADDPG.
•Week 5 (Jul 29-Aug 4) : Integrate cooperative-competitive dynamics and
optimize algorithms.
•Week 6 (Aug 5-11) : Evaluate performance against baselines and analyze
results.
•Week 7 (Aug 12-15) : Finalize thesis and prepare for submission.
Conclusion
This project aligns with MSc objectives, delivering academic and practical impact
through innovative MARL solutions. Feedback to refine its scope is welcome.
