# MARL for Google Cloud Platform Resource Management

## Slide Deck Brief (For Easy Explanation)

---

### 1. Background / Motivation
- Cloud platforms like GCP need to manage lots of resources for many users and jobs.
- It's hard to do this efficiently because workloads change all the time.
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lets us use many smart agents that learn to make good decisions together, adapting to changes.

---

### 2. Project Goals
- Build a system using MARL to make resource allocation smarter in a cloud-like environment.
- Use real data from Google clusters to make the experiments realistic.
- Show that our approach works better than traditional methods.

---

### 3. Methodology / Design
- The project is modular: separate parts for agents, environment, data, and visualization.
- Each agent controls some resources and learns by trying different actions and seeing what works best.
- The environment simulates a real cloud system using actual workload data.

---

### 4. Experimental Design
- We use real Google cluster data, process it, and extract useful patterns.
- We run experiments comparing MARL to standard scheduling algorithms.
- We measure things like how well resources are used, cost, and performance.

---

### 5. Results / Product
- MARL agents learn to adapt and use resources more efficiently than traditional methods.
- Dashboards and visualizations make it easy to see how the system performs and how agents make decisions.

---

### 6. Conclusion and Future Work
- MARL is a promising way to manage cloud resources because it can adapt and scale.
- In the future, we can try bigger systems and connect to real cloud platforms.

---

### 7. Q&A Preparation
- Be ready to explain:
  - Why MARL is useful for this problem.
  - How the system is built and why itâ€™s modular.
  - What the main results show.
  - What parts are your own work and what (if any) used GenAI help.
